        <h1>French mayor threatens €15,000 deposit to climb Mont Blanc</h1>

<h3>A French mayor says conditions on Mont Blanc are now so dangerous that climbers should pay a €15,000 (£12,640;
    $15,370) deposit to cover rescue and possible funeral costs.</h3>

<q cite="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62436466">
    The heatwave has increased rockfalls.</q>

<p>
    Jean-Marc Peillex is mayor of Saint-Gervais, a village at the foot of Western Europe's highest mountain, whose
    summit is at 4,807m (15,774ft). Those who ignored warnings and took the Goûter route up the mountain were playing
    "Russian roulette", he said. Mayor Peillex said the average cost of a rescue on the mountain was €10,000 and funeral
    costs were €5,000. "It is
    unacceptable for the French taxpayer to cover those costs," he said in a press release.
</p>

<p>
    His statement on the village's official website noted that mountain guides were now refusing to take climbers on the
    popular Goûter route - also known as the Royal Way - from Saint-Gervais or the nearby Alpine resort of Chamonix.
    Their decision is in force until mid-August at the earliest.
</p>

<p>
    Mayor Peillex castigated some "pseudo climbers" who insisted on attempting the climb "with death in their
    backpacks". He told the BBC "I wanted to make people react, to understand that today it's very dangerous, almost
    suicidal to go
    up".
</p>

<p>
    He has closed until further notice the mountain refuges at Goûter and Tête Rousse because of rockfalls. He said
    there had been a major rockfall on Thursday which would have killed anyone had they been in its path.
</p>

<p>
    He has not yet issued a legal ruling on the proposed deposit, but has the power to impose it, he told the BBC. He
    said the amount "has to be startling to focus attention on this". "If anyone thinks it's illegal they can go to
    court to challenge it," he added.
</p>

<p>
    He said a group of Romanians were found on the mountain on 30 July wearing shorts and trainers. A police helicopter
    ordered them through a loudhailer to turn back, he said, "and while they did so, they said they would return the
    next day"!
</p>

<h3>Climate impact</h3>

<p>
    A lack of winter snow and this summer's extraordinary heat have destabilised rocks and made crossing crevasses more
    difficult. The heat - attributed to climate change - has also increased the risk of avalanches in the Alps, as
    glaciers melt.
</p>

<p>
    An expert guide in Chamonix quoted by AFP news agency, Olivier Greber, said only a dozen to 20 skilled mountaineers
    were able to reach the summit each day, compared to 100-120 usually.
</p>

<p>
    Mont Blanc has 11 peaks above 4,000m in France and Italy and normally attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists
    every year. Besides Goûter, several other routes up the mountain, including from Courmayeur in Italy, remain open
    despite the hazards.
</p>

<p>
    Mayor Peillex said he did not have legal power to close the Goûter route.
</p>

<p>
    He told the BBC's Chris Bockman that, despite the danger, on Thursday alone 70 people attempted the climb and the
    number was rising each day.
</p>

<p>
    He said the number of rescues and deaths in the Mont Blanc massif had not risen this year. In most years there are
    hundreds of rescues in the massif and several dozen climbers' deaths.
